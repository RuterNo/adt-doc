### AssignmentAttemptRequest Usage
`operational/assignment/attempt` follows the request/response/state pattern. When a `request` is made to the request topic, a `response` will be available at the response topic once Ruter has finished processing.
In addition, if the `request` results in a change of `state`, the state topic will be updated to reflect the current state as seen by Ruter.

An `AssignmentAttemptRequest` can be made for:

| Action  | Description                                                                                   |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SignOn  | Creating an Assignment for a vehicle. Signing a vehicle on to a set of planned journeys/stops |
| SignOff | Signing a vehicle off from an assigned assignment                                             |
| Update  | Altering an assigned assignment                                                               |

- The message is composed of three operations (signOn, signOff, update). Each message must only contain one of these. If the message contains more than one part, the order of precedence is the following:
  1. signOn
  2. signOff
  3. update
- All attempts are effective as soon as Ruter has processed them.
- All attempt request will get an attempt response under the topic [assignment/attempt/response](../response/assignment-attempt-response.md)
- Any request leading to a change of existing assignment state is reflected under the topic [assignment/state](../../status/assignment-status.md)
- Please provide all fields marked as `reqired` in the schema specifications.

#### Sign On
- Any pre-existing assigned assignments will be signed off `AssignmentState.assigned=true`
- Sign on attempts are effective are effective as soon as Ruter has processed them. The vehicle will be assigned the new plan `AssignmentState.assigned=true`
- If the attempt request fails, the state of the vehicle is `AssignmentState.assigned=false`
- A `block` contains a set of journeys.
- A `vehicleTask` is a set of one or more blocks that can be served by one vehicle during one operating day.
  In the example below, the vehicle task with `vehicleTaskId=59001` contains 2 blocks.
- All signOn-attempts require the fields `vehicleTaskId` and `serviceWindow`.
  - `vehicleTaskId`: Can be found in the common file in the NeTEx export under this path `VehicleScheduleFrame.blocks[].Block.PrivateCode`
  - `serviceWindow`: Defines a time range for which journeys the vehicle should be signed on.
    - If the service window contains both `firstDepartureDateTime` and `lastArrivalDateTime`, the vehicle will be logged on
      to all the journeys in the vehicle task between those times. Note that the times may be on the same calendar date
      or on 2 consecutive dates.
    - If the service window contains only `firstDepartureDateTime`, the vehicle will be logged on
      to the journeys from `firstDepartureDateTime` to the end of that block.
