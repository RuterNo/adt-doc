### AssignmentAttemptResponse Usage
When an AssignmentAttemptRequest is made, and Ruter has finished processing, the results are presented as AssignmentAttemptResponse.
The response contains:
- `result` to indicate if processing by Ruter has been successfully processed, or not. See the schema for possible codes.
- `state` as a representation of the Assignment state as seen by Ruter after processing is completed.
