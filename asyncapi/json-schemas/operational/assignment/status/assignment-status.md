### AssignmentStatus Usage
Current Assignment State for a vehicle as seen by Ruter. The topic is `retained` so the current status is persisted on the mqtt-broker.
The topic is updated when an AssignmentAttemptRequest is made, processing is complete and/or the state has changed. 

_Note that Ruter could, in case of operational deviations, or missing sign offs, update the assignment. This update will be reflected here._
