This message indicates that the bus should stop on the next stop. On receiving this message, the operator should interpret 
it as if it was a regular press of a button on board the vehicle.

The stop-signalled light inside the vehicle should light up and a message should be produced on 
`ruter/{operatorId}/{vehicleId}/sensors/stop_button` as normal.
