Sale result message generated by RuterSalg. More details about fields can be found at https://ruterwiki.ruter.no/display/PNS/MQTT+Topics+consumed+and+produced+by+RuterSalg.

This topic is intended as a live view of sales, and must not be used as the complete truth. This is done elsewhere. This topic is intended for health surveillance, for anyone interesting in whether or not tickets are being sold, and also how many and what kind of tickets.

Some operators have suggested that they might be interested in using this topic to display sales results on screens separate from the RuterSalg application, intended as information to the travelers purchasing tickets. This topic is well suited for this use case.
