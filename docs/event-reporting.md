# Event Reporting API

Use this API to report cancellation and delay events, as well as other SLA breaches, directly to
Ruter, along with a flag indicating whether you as an operator consider that the event was outside
your control, and that you should be exempt from being fined for incurred/reported SLA breach(es).
