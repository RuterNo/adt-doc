# Traffic Event Reporting API

Use this API to report cancellation and delay events directly to Ruter, along with a flag indicating
whether you consider that the event was outside your control, and that you as an operator should be
exempt from being fined for breach(es) of contract incurred as a consequence of the traffic event.
